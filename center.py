where toys pretend to be lifeless in the presence of humans, Woody, a
pullstring cowboy doll, is the leader of a group of toys that are owned by a
boy named Andy Davis. With his family moving away one week before his
birthday, Andy is given a week-early party to spend with his friends, while
the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy
receives a spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear, whose impressive
features see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody becomes

return to his home planet, while Woody tries to convince him that he is just a
toy.""" ,

			"""After defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and securing
amnesty for their past crimes, Dominic Dom Toretto, Brian O'Conner, and the
rest of their team have returned to the United States to live normal lives
again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries
to help Letty Ortiz regain her memories. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother,
Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital the comatose Owen is being held
in and swears vengeance against Dom, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' DSS
office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw
engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely
injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again
and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a bomb, disguised in a package sent
from Tokyo, explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a
member of their team, is killed by Shaw in Tokyo. Dom later visits Hobbs in a
hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking
to avenge his brother. Dom then travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and
meets and races Sean Boswell, a friend of Han's who gives him personal items
found at Han's crash site. At Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom notices a car
observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, Shaw. Both prepare to
fight, Shaw slips away when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire. The team
is led by a man who calls himself Mr. Nobody, who says that he will assist Dom
in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain the God's Eye, a computer program that
uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker
named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman
Pearce, and Tej Parker then airdrop their cars over the Caucasus Mountains in
Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to
Abu Dhabi, where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing the
God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With the God's Eye near
telecommunications repeaters, the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a
remote factory. Dom, Brian, Mr. Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw,
but are ambushed by Jakande and his team, and are forced to flee while Jakande
obtains the God's Eye. At his own request, Mr. Nobody is then left to be
evacuated by helicopter. Left with no other choice, the team returns to Los
Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that
once they deal with Shaw, he will dedicate himself entirely to their family.
While Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a stealth helicopter
and an aerial drone, Ramsey attempts to hack into the God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing
the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an
ambulance. Ramsey then regains control of the God's Eye and shuts it down.
Meanwhile, Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on a parking garage,
before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of
the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at
Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, before
injuring himself when his car lands and crashes. Hobbs then shoots the bag of
grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom
is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed dead. As Letty cradles Dom's
body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she
remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, It's
about time. Shaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret,
high-security prison, 32 meters underground. At a beach, Brian and Mia play
with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej and Ramsey observe, acknowledging
that Brian is better off retired with his family. Dom silently leaves, but
Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. As Dom remembers the times that he
had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate
directions.""",
